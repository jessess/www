You have to work 40 hours a week. What? Ok, 32 hours a week sounds pretty good. What? Ok, ok, 4-hour work week?

There's a lot of stress and mental overhead about hour many hours of the day need to be dedicated to work.

### Want to know my approach?
I dunno, get your shit done.

### But seriously
Set manageable expectations about what you want to do in a 1 or 2 week interval. At the end of your work week,
if you've finished all of those tasks, than you have succeeded. Don't cheat yourself, though. Be sure to set feasible
goals with a mix of challenging tasks and busy work.
