I am traveling with <a href="http://www.remoteyear.com/" target="_blank">Remote Year</a> from June 1st, 2016 to May 31st, 2017.

Remote Year brings together 75 people and facilitates co-working spaces and housing for a year of travel to 12 different cities. Here is our itinerary.

I am coming into this with 0 expectations and an open mind.
