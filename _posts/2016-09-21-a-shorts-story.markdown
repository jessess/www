Trying to find a good pair of shorts is harder than goldilocks finding the perfect porridge.

> They're too long.

> They don't have enough flexibility.

> The waist stretches out after I buy them.

> The belt loop doesn't fit my belt.

These are all complaints that I've had when searching for shorts. This is my 4th month in the Remote Year bubble and I am on my 3rd pair of shorts. The pair that I started with, in Prague, stayed in Prague. European heat and the blend of fabric didn't mesh (get it?) well. My next pair, that I acquired in Belgrade, was great. They were the perfect length for Eastern Europe style. Perhaps they were Belgrate 😶? However, the combination of not having a clothes-shrinking-dryer and cheaply-made material yielded me with a pair of shirts that would barely stay up without a belt.

I am happy to announce that I have found them, here in Lisbon! My shorts! They're blue. They're the perfect. The length is great. They were affordable.

So there you have it. A short story about finding shorts.
