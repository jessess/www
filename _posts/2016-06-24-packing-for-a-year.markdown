Leave that extra t-shirt and jacket behind. You probably don't need it.

I am a big supporter of bringing as little as possible and only taking your essentials.
I left for a one-year trip and I have been traveling with my stuff for about a month.

Here's my packing list and how I've done so far.

<strong>edit</strong> <br /><em>September 19, 2016:</em> I've made some adjustments to quantities and items that I currently own.

## Carrying stuff
<p>1. 60L duffel <br /> <span class="note">A Patagonia blackhole duffel.</span></p>
<p>2. 22L backpack <br /> <span class="note">Camelback bag + water bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="item-gone">3. Collapsible backpack</span> <br /> <span class="note">by Tortuga Backpacks.</span></p>
<p>4. Laundry sack <br /> <span class="note">For keeping dirty laundry quarantined.</span></p>

## Clothes & Accessories
<p>5. 5 t-shirts <br /> <span class="note">Laundry is your friend.</span></p>
<p>6. 4 pairs of ExOfficio's <br /> <span class="note">They never smell! Jk, they do, but it takes a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="item-gone">7. Flannel shirt</span> <br /> <span class="note">Because sometimes sleeves are the way to go.</span></p>
<p>8. Hoodie <br /> <span class="note">Works great as a base layer under the puffer.</span></p>
<p>9. 1 pairs of pants <br /> <span class="note">When shorts don't make sense.</span></p>
<p>10. Regular Shorts <br /> <span class="note">When it's too hot for pants.</span></p>
<p>11. 3 light weight running shirts <br /> <span class="note">Because I run a lot and I have a limited amount of t-shirts.</span></p>
<p>12. 3 pairs of mesh shorts <br /> <span class="note">2 for running and 1 for wearing around.</span></p>
<p>13. Rain Coat <br /> <span class="note">It rains sometimes and I hate umbrellas.</span></p>
<p>14. Puffer jacket <br /> <span class="note">For colder climates, hikes, or night time.</span></p>
<p>15. Running shoes and Gym shoes <br /> <span class="note">For running! And for the gym!</span></p>
<p>16. Timberland EarthKeepers <br /> <span class="note">These are great as rain boots, hiking, or every day boots. I wear them almost every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="item-gone">17. Casual shoes that look good with shorts</span> <br /> <span class="note">Because the boots above look silly with shorts.</span></p>
<p>18. 2 Pairs of sunglasses <br /> <span class="note">I like sunglasses, ok? Also, one is perscription ðŸ¤“.</span></p>
<p>19. Reading glasses <br /> <span class="note">Because I look at a computer screen a lot.</span></p>
<p>20. Running belt <br /> <span class="note">For keeping things like keys, phone, and some money for longer runs.</span></p>
<p>21. Regular belt <br /> <span class="note">Because my pants never fit right.</span></p>

## Electronics
<p>22. Android 5x <br /> <span class="note">My everyday phone</span></p>
<p>23. Unlocked iPhone 5s <br /> <span class="note">This actually broke and I probably won't replace it. But it's a good idea for a local data plan / tethering if needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="item-gone">24. Amazon Fire Tablet</span> <br /> <span class="note">For longer flights and bus rides.</span></p>
<p>25. 13" MBP <br /> <span class="note">For computing.</span></p>
<p>26. 2 power banks <br /> <span class="note">For charging stuff. It's easier to charge your phone or camera with one of these when you have limited power outlets and converters.</span></p>
<p><span class="item-gone">27. Running watch</span> <br /> <span class="note">For tracking pace and keeping time.</span></p>
<p>29. Sony a6000 <br /> <span class="note">I downsized all of my camera gear to this. It's a great camera.</span></p>
<p>30. Power converter <br /> <span class="note">For charging devices in a foreign place.</span></p>
<p>31. A bee-hive of power and charging cables <br /> <span class="note">For charging all of the above electronics.</span></p>

## Misc.
<p>32. Binder clips <br /> <span class="note">I use these as a wallet and it's also great for keeping cables organized.</span></p>
<p>33. Dropbox pro <br /> <span class="note">For keeping my photos and also copies of my passport and credit cards.</span></p>
<p>34. Google Photos <br /> <span class="note">Because it's awesome.</span></p>
<p>35. Google Fi <br /> <span class="note">As a cell carrier. You get LTE most places around the world.</span></p>
<p>36. Passport <br /> <span class="note">For traveling internationally.</span></p>
<p>37. Chase Sapphire credit card <br /> <span class="note">No foreign transaction fee, travel incentives, and so much more.</span></p>
<p>38. Fidelity cash management account <br /> <span class="note">You can take money out at any ATM for free, no bank charge and no ATM charge.</span></p>
<p>39. 2 Lacrosse balls <br /> <span class="note">For rolling out a tight back and other muscles.</span></p>
<p>40. Quick dry towel <br /> <span class="note">When you need a towel and don't want to carry around a wet towel.</span></p>
<p>41. Travel locks <br /> <span class="note">Sometimes hostels are sketchy.</span></p>
<p>42. Carabiner <br /> <span class="note">For attaching things to other things.</span></p>
<p>43. Water bottle <br /> <span class="note">For drinking</span></p>
<p>44. Travel insurance <br /> <span class="note">With world nomads, because, you just never know what can happen.</span></p>

Ok, hmm, this does seem like a lot? Not really. Everything fits pretty nicely in the 60L bag and the 22L backpack.
The 60L bag weights about 10kg and the backpack weights about 7.5kg. So, they are allowed on most airlines are carry-ons with no issue.

What's in your bag? Have any other questions with what's in mine? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/danielcgold">@danielcgold</a>.
