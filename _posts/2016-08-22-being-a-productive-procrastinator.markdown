What is procrastination, really? Is being really good at crastinating, like, a pro? Is it being lazy? Is it avoiding situations? For me, it's all of the above. Well, maybe not being a pro crastinator (is that even a word?).

I usually have multiple thought processes going on in my mind simultaneously. I'm constantly trying to remember *this* while doing _that_. Sometimes, I don't want to do *this* or _that_ and I try to keep my mind occupied by doing something _else_.

Some of my best work comes out of doing something _else_. It's when I am focused and determined to finish an actual piece of work. It's usually something productive that I would rather do. Like, edit photos, writing a blog post, coming up with new ideas, or research an idea or thought.

Thinking about it, I wouldn't really called procrastination procrastinating, I would call it being productive.
