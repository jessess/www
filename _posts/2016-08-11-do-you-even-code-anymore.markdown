I am a front end web developer. I like CSS. I like HTML. I like designing things. I like resizing browsers.
Lately, most of my time has been spent going through stories, clicking buttons and wasting time. I don't like it.

If I were to guess -- most days, out of the number of hours that I work, probably 10% is writing code. Of that 10%, probably
another 10% is spent writing quality code. 

Help!
