Have you ever woken up on a Thursday or a Tuesday and think to yourself:

> Yes! It's Friday -- oh no, wait, it's actually not <span class="emoji">ðŸ˜ž</span>.

Yea, that's a pretty bad feeling, isn't it? So what if you can live in a world
where that never happens because every day is a Friday.

Recently, I have been flattening my perception of days of the week. How have I done this
and why does it matter?

### How
* Not setting an alarm.
* Not having rituals on specific days of the week (I'm looking at you, Taco Tuesdays).
* Changing my thinking: There are not 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. Every day is a new day.
* Not holding back and overdoing it (drinking? eating? partying? anything?) on "Friday".

### Why
I used to be exhausted by the end of the work week. I would save up all of the mental
stress and let it go on Friday in what ever way possible. I realized it's probably not
a good thing to do and wanted to make a change.

This is that change.

Also, this was written on a Friday <span class="emoji">ðŸ¤”</span>.
