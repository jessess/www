There are too many things: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Gchat, text message, email, Slack, Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt, and like, so so so many more.

But seriously, is it really a good idea to check Reddit in between code builds? Check Prodct Hunt in between emails? Wake up to Instagram? Scroll through Twitter when walking down the street? Facebook on the train? It's exhausting. 

How does anyone ever get anything done? I don't.

All of the context switching from problem to problem. Multi tasking is a thing but not really a good thing. 

Turn it off. Focus on one thing. Make awesome stuff.
